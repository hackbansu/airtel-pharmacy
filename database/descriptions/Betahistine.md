# **Description**
Venlafaxine belongs to a group of medicines known as serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
antidepressants. It is prescribed for the treatment of depression, and also for the treatment of generalised anxiety
disorder (GAD).
Depression can develop for no apparent reason, or it may be triggered by a life event such as a relationship
problem, bereavement, or illness. People with depression have a consistently low mood and other symptoms
severe enough to interfere with normal day-to-day activities. Although it is not fully understood what causes
depression, an imbalance of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain is thought to be a factor. Venlafaxine works
by regulating the levels of chemicals in the brain, called serotonin and noradrenaline; this eases the symptoms of
depression in some people.
Although venlafaxine is often used to treat depression, it can also ease the symptoms of GAD. This is a condition
where anxiety is a major symptom. Venlafaxine can help ease the anxiety even if you are not depressed.
